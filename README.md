Predicting atrial fibrillation from RR intervals. This repository contains the Scripts and libraries to train the neural network and make predictions from a representative group of patients taken from the open-source [PAF Prediction Challenge Database](https://physionet.org/content/afpdb/1.0.0/) from physionet. .  

### Dependencies
This code was tested on Python 3.9.12 with Tensorflow 2.8 and MATLAB R2020a

### Executing program

* main.m: Generates the data for training the neural network and make predictions.
* train&predict.py: Use to train the neural network and make predictions.
